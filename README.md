Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?


# Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

# Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
